# Description
Fitness Tracker is an easy way to log and view daily workouts so that you can reach your fitness goals quicker.

# How It Works
Fitness Tracker uses a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and has routes handled with express. When users load the page, they are given the option to create a new workout or continue with their previous workout. By clicking on the fitness tracker dashboard link in the top left, users can see charts and graphs of their workouts to better track their progress. 

# Built With
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, Node.js, Express.js

# Notes
I was responsible for the back end of this app; setting up the routes with Express and creating the Mongoose schema.
